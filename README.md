Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

The first part of the code focuses on scraping titles and preview text from a Mars news website. It follows the following steps:

1. Visiting the Mars news website using automated browsing.
2. Creating a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.
3. Extracting the titles and preview text from the text elements and storing them in Python dictionaries.
4. Storing all the dictionaries in a Python list.
5. Printing the list of dictionaries to confirm successful scraping.
6. Quitting the browser.

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

The second part of the code involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a different website. It follows the following steps:

1. Visiting the Mars temperature data website using automated browsing.
2. Creating a Beautiful Soup object to scrape the data from the HTML table on the website.
3. Storing the scraped data in a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.
4. Examining the data types of each column and converting them if necessary.
5. Analyzing the dataset by answering specific questions using Pandas functions and plotting the results.
6. Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file.
7. Quitting the browser.

The code is divided into separate parts to scrape data from different websites and perform specific analyses. Each part is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and steps involved.
